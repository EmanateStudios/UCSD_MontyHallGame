        <p>Thanks for participating in this study. You will play a very simple video game for about 60 minutes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Once you start, you cannot defocus the window or do anything else (like check your email) or you will be disqualified and not be credited for participation.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Please read the game instructions below carefully as there will be a quiz before the game begins. 
            (That lets us be sure everyone starts with the same basic understanding of what’s going on here.)</p>

        <p>On each play, you will be shown 3 doors. You will open one of the doors by clicking on the door. If there is a treasure chest 
            behind the door you just opened, you will gain 20 points. If instead there is rubble, you will lose 10 points. </p>
            <br>
        
        <p>Your goal is to open as many doors with treasure chests as you can. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Getting a good score is not pure luck, and it is not just a matter of how you pick which door to open. It may also be how you open the door.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The game has 6 rounds each with 20 plays. Between each round you will have a 20 second rest period. Remember that you cannot defocus 
            the window during the game including these rest periods.</p>
            <br>
        <p>We need your full concentration throughout this experiment. Please try your best! Thanks for participating, and have fun!</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you run into any technical difficulties, please contact us at the email listed for this SONA experiment.</p>
